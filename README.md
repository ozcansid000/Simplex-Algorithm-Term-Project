WHAT DOES IT DO? 
Optimization for business is a program that solves business problems by coding the simplex algorithm
like maximizing profit or minimizing costs. The algorithm takes into account limitations or constraints that the business has.

TO TEST:
Run "optimization for business" file. You need two files, cmu 112 graphics and
TP_classes.

Follow commands in the pop-ups. Here is a sample optimization problem's inputs 
since the app is difficult to test for someone who doesn't know the field:

TO TEST MAX PROBLEM
1) Press Start
2) Enter "2" as number of variables
3) Enter "2" as number of constraints
4) Press a to add constraints as prompted
5) Enter "2,-1,G,10" as first constraint
6) Enter "1,1,L,20" as second constraint
7) Click next to display added constraints
8) Press a to add objective as prompted
9) Enter "5,10,0"
10) Select "Max" as your problem
11) Press "Done"
12) Select "general" as your problem type to display optimal solution

TO TEST MIN PROBLEM
1) Press Start
2) Enter "2" as number of variables
3) Enter "4" as number of constraints
4) Press a to add constraints as prompted
5) Enter "2,-1,G,10" as first constraint
6) Enter "1,1,L,20" as second constraint
7) Enter "8,3,L,85" as third constraint
8) Enter "-9,7,L,42" as fourth constraint
9) Click next to display added constraints
10) Press a to add objective as prompted
11) Enter "2,7,0"
12) Select "Min" as your problem
13) Press "Done"
14) Select "general" as your problem type to display optimal solution

With these examples you can test that the max and min features work.

In the deliverable I will be presenting problems that go along with the
assignment, transport, and general problems. These are all different inputs
that use the same algorithm.

***You can gauge the complexity of the algorithm using the link I attached at the top
that directs you to the source I used. It goes through matrix algebra of the algorithm.
I think it is worth noting that the algorithm uses 17 functions and is 300 lines long. 
A lot of scenarios are playing out and a lot of numbers are being processed. Upwards
of 20 hours was spent on this portion***

There are examples of several different types of problems that this program
would be useful for solving in the file called "TP examples", the list isn't
comprehensive and this algorithm can really be applied to almost any optimization problem. 
I will include some of these in the demo for the TP3 deliverable.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO GUIDE ME THROUGH THIS PROCESS!!!!
